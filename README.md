SOA patterns used:
- API gateway : Implement a service which is the entry point into the microservices-based application from external API client
- Domain Inventory : Services are grouped into manageable, domain-specific service inventories, each of which can be independently standardized, governed, and owned.
- Service normalization: service are designed with an emphasis on service boundary alignment.
- Service encapsulation :  solution logic is encapsulated by a service so that it is positioned as an enterprise resource capable of functioning beyond the boundary for which it is initially delivered.
- Containerization : Services are deployed independently, or together with composed services, as autonomous units that are packaged into independently manageable and autonomous container images, each of which includes the servicesâ€™ underlying system dependencies. Tooling is provided to manage the building, deploying and operating of the containers.
- Trusted Subsystem : service is designed to use its own credentials for authentication and authorization
